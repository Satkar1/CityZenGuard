For e.g. if a person has to file a case in court, he would be provided legal aid (in form of assignment of a Legal Services Advocate). However, if he only needs some help in drafting a legal notice to be sent prior to filing of a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881, he would get legal consultation/ advice regarding the same. A person who does not come under the purview of Section 12 of Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to be eligible for free legal aid, can still avail legal advice and assistance from the Legal Services Institutions.",

For e.g. if a person has to file a case in court, he would be provided legal aid (in form of assignment of a Legal Services Advocate).

A person who does not come under the purview of Section 12 of Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to be eligible for free legal aid, can still avail legal advice and assistance from the Legal Services Institutions.",
